long_description	afew is an initial tagging script for notmuch mail (http://notmuchmail.org/).   \
                        Its basic task is to provide automatic tagging each time new mail is registered \
                        with notmuch. In a classic setup, you might call it after 'notmuch new' in an   \
                        offlineimap post sync hook. In addition to more elementary features such as     \
                        adding tags based on email headers or maildir folders, handling killed threads  \
                        and spam, it can do some heavy magic in order to /learn/ how to initially tag   \
                        your mails based on their content.
